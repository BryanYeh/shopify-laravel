## Usage:
Make sure to use ```use Bryanyeh\Shopify\Facades\Shopify;``` wherever you are planning to use this package.


### Asking for permission to install the app
Make sure to use the middleware ```shopifyrequest```
```php
use Bryanyeh\Shopify\Facades\Shopify;

Route::get('install', function(Request $request){
    return redirect(Shopify::init($request->input('shop'))->install('https://example.com/confirm'));
})->middleware('shopifyrequest');
```


### Retreiving the access token
To do this you will need to use the middlewares ```shopifynonce``` and ```shopifyrequest```
```php
use Bryanyeh\Shopify\Facades\Shopify;

Route::get('confirm', function(Request $request){
    $access_token = Shopify::init($request->input('shop'))->getAccessToken($request->input('code'))['access_token'];

    //save the access_token for later use

    //redirect to success or billing page

})->middleware('shopifynonce', 'shopifyrequest');
```


### Verifying webhooks
Simply use the middleware ```shopifywebhook```


### Verifying proxy requests
Simply use the middleware ```shopifyproxy```


### Accessing API resource
```php
use Bryanyeh\Shopify\Facades\Shopify;

$geturi = '/admin/products/count.json' ;
$posturi = '/admin/products.json';
$puturi = '/admin/products/632910392.json';
$deleteuri = '/admin/products/632910392.json';

$shop = Shopify::init($my_shopify_store,$access_token);
$shop->get($geturi, [if any]);
$shop->post($posturi, [data]);
$shop->put($puturi, [data]);
$shop->delete($deleteuri);
```


Everything that gets will be in a form of an array containing:
```
statusCode   :  200 or 400 or status code
reasonPhrase :  just a phrase that goes with the status code
callLimit    :  HTTP_X_SHOPIFY_SHOP_API_CALL_LIMIT
????         :  expected response data shopify returns
```


## Errors
This package throws several exceptions. You are free to use try/catch statements or to rely on the Laravel built-in exceptions handler.
- ```InvalidNonceException```
    - The state returned during installation phase does not match the nonce generated by the app
- ```InvalidSignatureException```
    - The signature from the proxy request is invalid
- ```InvalidShopifyDomainException```
    - The provided shopify domain does not match ```<slug-term>.myshopify.com```
- ```InvalidHmacException```
    - The hmac from the request is invalid
- ```InvalidWebHookException```
    - The webhook request is invalid
- ```InvalidMethodRequest```
    - only ```get/post/put/delete``` is allowed, look at [Acessing API Resource](#accessing-api-resource)


## Notes:
- Nonce is automatically taken care for you
- Make sure to add your incoming webhook routes to the ```app/Http/Middleware/VerifyCsrfToken.php``` in the ```except``` array
